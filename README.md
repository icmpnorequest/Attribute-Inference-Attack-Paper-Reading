# Attribute Inference Attack Paper Reading

Contributed by Yantong Lai

I've been reading these papers about **attribute inference attack** recently and collected them as a paper list. The repository keeps on maintenance. 

**Welcome to your contribution:**
- Paper about **Attribute Inference Attack / Defense** methods;
- Experiments code in those paper;
- Paper reading notes with those paper

**Thanks in advance!**


## 1. Attribute Inference Attack

Please Notice: **Paper listed below is in Paper/Attack directory.**

### 1.1 User Attribute Inference Based on Text

### 1.2 User Attribute Inference Based on Behavior
Please Notice: Behavior mainly stands for "likes" or "status" in social media, not including "following/followed".
